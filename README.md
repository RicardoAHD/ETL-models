# ETL-models

Overview:

In the data warehouse, managing a large volume of data is crucial. With numerous tables and dependencies between them, it becomes imperative to handle transformations effectively. Failure in transforming one table could lead to a cascading effect on others. Hence, a well-organized and visualized pipeline is essential for smooth data processing.

About the Code:

This repository contains a Python script that leverages Airflow, a platform to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows. Airflow utilizes Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) to configure tasks and define dependencies between them.

Key Components:

1.	DAG Configuration:
•	The script defines a DAG named 'dim_products' with specific configurations such as schedule interval, start date, and default arguments for tasks.
2.	TimeDeltaSensor:
•	A sensor task named 'delay_sensor' is included to wait for a specific duration before proceeding with the subsequent tasks. This helps in managing dependencies and ensuring that tasks execute at the right time.
3.	BigQueryOperator:
•	The primary task, 'transform_dim_products', utilizes the BigQueryOperator provided by Airflow. This operator enables the execution of BigQuery SQL queries to transform data.
•	The SQL query provided selects data from a source table in Google BigQuery, applies transformations, and loads the transformed data into a destination table.
•	Parameters such as project, dataset, destination table, write disposition, BigQuery connection ID, and SQL query are configured within the operator.

Importance:

Utilizing Airflow and its operators, especially the BigQueryOperator, streamlines the data transformation process. By defining tasks as directed acyclic graphs, dependencies are managed efficiently, ensuring smooth execution of data pipelines. This approach enhances visibility, scalability, and reliability in handling large-scale data transformations within the data warehouse environment.
